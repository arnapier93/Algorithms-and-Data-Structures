Name:   Andrew Napier
ID:	01813145

Task 1. Implement Sequential Search Algorithm, test it on 1000; 100,000 and 1,000,000 randomly generated numbers, record the iteration count.

Count for 1,000:           870
Count for 100,000:      84,006
Count for 1,000, 000:  186,864
			      
Task 2. Implement Binary Search Algorithm, test it on 1000 ; 100,000 and 1,000,000 randomly generated (sorted) numbers, record the iteration count.   
			      
Count for 1,000:             9
Count for 100,000: 	    17
Count for 1,000, 000: 	    19
